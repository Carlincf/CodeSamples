  <h1>Code Samples</h1>
  <p>This repo contains 2 java files: ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr, which uses a fair Semaphore and a ConcurrentHashMap to controll access to a pool of resources, and FairSemaphoreMO, which implements a fair Semaphore using Java monitor objects.
  <br>
  For context, these files were part of an adroid app used by students to demonstrate multithreaded performance on mobile devices. Themed after Lord of the Rings, a collection of "beings" (Hobbits, Wizards, and Nazgul) took turns sharing a pool of Palantir. I was provided the method definitions but none of the implementations; all comments and method implementations are my work alone.</p>
